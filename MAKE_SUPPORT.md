# PowerShell Make Support for Meraki Info

This project provides comprehensive `make` support for PowerShell environments, delivering the same functionality as the traditional Makefile but optimized for Windows development with enhanced features and ARM64 support.

## üéØ Overview

The PowerShell make system consists of multiple components that work together to provide a seamless build experience across all platforms and architectures, including modern ARM64 systems.

## üìÅ Files Included

### 1. `make.ps1` - Main PowerShell Make Wrapper
A full-featured PowerShell script providing complete Makefile functionality with enhanced Windows support and ARM64 architecture support.

### 2. `make.bat` - Batch File Wrapper  
Enables running `make` commands from Command Prompt by automatically invoking the PowerShell script.

### 3. `PowerShell-Make-Function.ps1` - Global Make Function
A PowerShell function for system-wide `make` command support that can be added to your PowerShell profile.

### 4. `build.ps1` - Simple Build Script
Lightweight PowerShell script for basic building needs without the full make system complexity.

### 5. `build-windows.ps1` - Advanced Build Script
Feature-rich PowerShell script with detailed logging and comprehensive build options.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```powershell
# Show all available targets
.\make.ps1 help

# Build for current platform
.\make.ps1 build

# Build for all platforms and architectures
.\make.ps1 build-all

# Run tests
.\make.ps1 test

# Clean build artifacts
.\make.ps1 clean
```

### ARM64 Support
```powershell
# Build for Apple Silicon Macs
.\make.ps1 build-mac-arm

# Build for ARM64 Linux servers

```

### Option 2: Global Make Function
Add system-wide `make` command support:

1. **Edit your PowerShell profile:**
   ```powershell
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```

2. **Add the contents of `PowerShell-Make-Function.ps1`**

3. **Reload your profile:**
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

4. **Use `make` globally:**
   ```powershell
   cd any-project-with-make.ps1
   make build-all    # Automatically finds and uses make.ps1
   ```

### Option 3: PATH Integration (Advanced)
Add the project directory to your PATH environment variable for ultimate convenience.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Execution Policy
**Error**: "execution of scripts is disabled"
```powershell
# Solution: Set execution policy for current user
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Missing Dependencies
**Error**: "'go' is not recognized"
```powershell
# Solution: Install Go and verify PATH
go version
# If not found, install Go from https://golang.org/dl/
```

### ARM64 Build Issues
**Error**: "unsupported GOOS/GOARCH pair"
```powershell
# Solution: Ensure Go 1.16+ for ARM64 support
go version
# Should show go1.16 or later
```

### Make Function Not Working
**Issue**: Global `make` command not found
```powershell
# Check profile exists
Test-Path $PROFILE

# Create profile if missing
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force

# Add function to profile
# Copy contents of PowerShell-Make-Function.ps1

# Reload profile
. $PROFILE

# Verify function
Get-Command make
```

### Permission Issues
**Error**: Access denied or permission errors
```powershell
# Solution: Run PowerShell as Administrator
# Or check file permissions
Get-Acl .\make.ps1
```
